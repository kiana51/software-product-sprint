      <p class="p3">This is my portfolio.
          Some fun facts about me is that I have visited 65 countries, and I have a pet rabbit! :)

      <p class = "p3">
          I am a first-gen Cuban-Jamaican American living in South Florida. I grew up with a passion for soccer, going to the beach,
          and just being active in general. I love documenting events through the eyes of a camera and love creating
          things that make the world a little more interesting.
      </p>
      <p class = "p3">
          I study computer science at the University of Florida and I am interested in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Full Stack development. 
          My ambition, my adaptability, and my devotion to learn everyday are my biggest strengths.
          My ultimate life goal is to help in developing underdeveloped communities by introducing the key concepts 
          of technology into their systems because I strongly believe that technology is one essential tool that provides 
          the greatest stride toward progress.
